House Price Prediction using Python, NumPy, Pandas, Linear Regression, Lasso, and Ridge Regression
This project aims to predict house prices using machine learning techniques in Python. We'll utilize the popular libraries NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation and analysis, and implement linear regression, Lasso regression, and Ridge regression models for prediction.
1. Data Preparation
 * Load the dataset:
   * Import the pandas library.
   * Use pd.read_csv() to load the housing data from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.
 * Explore the data:
   * Examine the data using methods like head(), describe(), and info() to understand its structure, statistical properties, and missing values.
 * Data cleaning:
   * Handle missing values by either removing rows with missing values or imputing missing values with appropriate techniques (e.g., mean, median, or more sophisticated methods).
   * Consider transforming categorical variables into numerical representations (e.g., one-hot encoding).
 * Feature selection:
   * Identify relevant features that may significantly influence house prices.
   * Consider techniques like correlation analysis or feature importance from tree-based models.
 * Data splitting:
   * Split the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split() from scikit-learn. This allows us to train the models on one part of the data and evaluate their performance on unseen data.
2. Model Implementation
 * Linear Regression:
   * Create a LinearRegression object from scikit-learn.
   * Fit the model to the training data using the fit() method.
   * Make predictions on the test data using the predict() method.
 * Lasso Regression:
   * Create a Lasso object, specifying the regularization parameter (alpha).
   * Fit the model to the training data.
   * Make predictions on the test data.
 * Ridge Regression:
   * Create a Ridge object, specifying the regularization parameter (alpha).
   * Fit the model to the training data.
   * Make predictions on the test data.
3. Model Evaluation
 * Calculate performance metrics:
   * Use metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared to evaluate the performance of each model.
   * Compare the performance of the three models to determine which one provides the best predictions.
 * Visualize results:
   * Create plots to visualize the relationship between actual and predicted house prices for each model.
   * Consider using scatter plots or residual plots to identify patterns or outliers.
4. Model Selection and Refinement
 * Choose the best model:
   * Select the model with the best performance based on the evaluation metrics.
 * Fine-tune hyperparameters:
   * Experiment with different values of the regularization parameter (alpha) for Lasso and Ridge regression to potentially improve performance.
   * Consider using techniques like cross-validation to find the optimal hyperparameter values.
 * Iterate and improve:
   * Continue refining the model by incorporating additional features, trying different preprocessing techniques, or exploring other machine learning algorithms.
